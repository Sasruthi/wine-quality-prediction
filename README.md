This wine quality prediction involves certain features like value of fixed acidity,	volatile acidity,	citric acid	,
residual sugar,	chlorides,	free sulfur dioxide	total sulfur dioxide,	density,	pH	,sulphates,	alcohol.
With the amount of concentration of these chemicals the quality of the wine is predicted.
